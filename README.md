A minimalist :dolphin: docker image for **Ruby** based on latest **[Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/)**. 

**This image is not based on ruby:alpine**. Using this image you're able to use the latest Alpine Linux version and install any ruby version.

## What is this?

- :whale: Lightweight docker image based on top of latest Alpine Linux image;
- :gem: Supports **any** **Ruby** version (*Don't need pull other image version*);
- :elephant: Ready to **PostgreSQL** usage (**if you use pg gem**);
- :hammer: Ready to build gem with native extensions (like **Nokogiri**);
- :stuck_out_tongue: Ready to run Rails + PostgreSQL application.
